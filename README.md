# Statistical Testing With Fake Data

The jupyter notebook contained within this repository includes a detailed walkthrough of an effort to conduct meaningful statistical testing using data from a relational database housing fake data. The famous 'Northwind' database was generated by Microsoft to use for testing purposes and served as fictitious company data from which I could ask questions of the data followed by statistical testing to either accept or reject the null hypothesis. 

A narrative was generated around the project where 'Northwind' had contracted with a fictitious consulting firm, JE Consulting (me), to perform analysis and statistical testing for management. The accompanying notebook walks the viewer through the steps and code used to perform the analysis 'requested' by Northwind's management. 

Some of the project highlights include the following: 

- Queried relational database using SQLAlchemy to extract data needed for statistical testing
- Employed Tableau to produce a few minor EDA graphics
- Conducted Two-Sample T-Test, Tukey Test, and ANOVA statistical tests
